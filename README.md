# üêü Fish Detection Project

This project is part of a specialization assignment focused on **fish detection using computer vision and deep learning**. The goal was to detect fish in underwater images using a trained model, and later test its feasibility on a Raspberry Pi device.

The development was conducted in two distinct phases: a classification approach using TensorFlow (MobileNetV2), followed by a transition to YOLOv4 object detection due to system constraints and better real-time performance.
